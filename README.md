This is a web app for translating English sentences into Sign language letter signs. So if you were ever in doubt how to communicate with a deaf person, and you don't have pen and paper to type this down, you now have the signs to do it! (However if you have a phone to transale this, you might as well show him your phone with the English sentence)
